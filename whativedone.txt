1. How did i create a new commmand ?
    cd ~
    touch ~/.custom_bash_commands.sh
    vi .custom_bash_commands.sh
              |
              -----> #!/bin/bash

                     #User want to listen to Rock
                     function Gaxillic(){
                           echo 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPND9CP_Omw&list=RDUPND9CP_Omw&index=1&ab_channel=11feinly2'
                     }
    source ~/.custom_bash_commands.sh      #this make .custom_bash_commands.sh executable and build the commands


2. Type the new command "Gaxillic" in terminal and it will show up

BIG THING. Making a repository that when installed will create a lot of commands to the user. Initialy i wana aim to Fedora 39 OS but l8 detect other operational systems as well.
 
ps.  Alias - command shortcuts - can be used as well like:
         alias gcl="git clone‚Äù
